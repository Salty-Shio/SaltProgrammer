# Welcome to my Github!

I'm just here to make cool things. I recently graduated from college with a BCS.

This is a new github account that I made using a personal e-mail. My other github was created using my school email. Because of that, most of my stuff is on my old github, and a lot of that is also private becuase I was requested to keep the classwork in private repos. My github looks a little empty right now, but its because I contribute mainly to a lot of private repos.

So what am I doing right now? I'm currently creating a personal webpage using React where I'm hoping to host my portfolio of projects I plan on working on. I hope to have a nice framework built where I can share cool things that I make, programming challenges that I try, new skills that I learn, note about what I've learned about programming, and much more!

So feel free to check back here and see what I have going on!
